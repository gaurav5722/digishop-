    Basically E-commerce is a Electronic-Commerce which means to “selling or
buying the products via internet”. Here we have created a website of fruits shop
giving it a name “DiGi Shop”.We have a deep concern about those people who
have a very busy schedule and not have the enough time to go to the market.In
the current scenario everybody wants to save their time and preffered to shop
digitally.
 So, DiGi Shop provide themselves a digital market for
making a online order for fruits as per their choice.
